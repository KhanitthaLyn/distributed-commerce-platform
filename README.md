🚀 Microservices Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates a simple microservices architecture consisting of three independent services:
👤 User Service — Port 8000 (🗄️ SQL Database)
📦 Product Service — Port 8001 (🗄️ SQL Database)
🛒 Order Service — Port 8002 (🗄️ SQL Database)

Each service runs on its own port and maintains its own dedicated database, following key microservices principles:
🔗 Loose coupling
🚀 Independent deployment
🗃️ Separated data ownership
📈 Scalable and maintainable architecture
