🚀 Microservices Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates a simple microservices architecture consisting of three independent services:

👤 User Service 

📦 Product Service 

🛒 Order Service 

Each service runs on its own port and maintains its own dedicated database, following key microservices principles:

🔗 Loose coupling

🚀 Independent deployment

🗃️ Separated data ownership

📈 Scalable and maintainable architecture
